# OCFS Web Page

This is, at least for now, the official website for OCFS documenation.

See [here](https://ocfs.github.io/partitions) for documentation on the recommended partitioning scheme.

See [here](https://ocfs.github.io/brofs) for documentation on the Bootloader Read-Only File System.

See [here](https://ocfs.github.io/ocfs) for documentation on the filesystem itself.
